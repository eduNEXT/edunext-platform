#   generic-ci-tests.sh
#
#   Execute all tests for edx-platform.
#
#   This script can be called from CI jobs that define
#   these environment variables:
#
#   `TEST_SUITE` defines which kind of test to run.
#   Possible values are:
#
#       - "quality": Run the quality (pycodestyle/pylint) checks
#       - "lms-unit": Run the LMS Python unit tests
#       - "cms-unit": Run the CMS Python unit tests
#       - "js-unit": Run the JavaScript tests
#       - "commonlib-unit": Run Python unit tests from the common/lib directory
#       - "commonlib-js-unit": Run the JavaScript tests and the Python unit
#           tests from the common/lib directory
#       - "bok-choy": Run acceptance tests that use the bok-choy framework
#
#   `SHARD` is a number indicating which subset of the tests to build.
#
#       For "bok-choy" and "lms-unit", the tests are put into shard groups
#       using the 'attr' decorator (e.g. "@attr(shard=1)"). Anything with
#       the 'shard=n' attribute will run in the nth shard. If there isn't a
#       shard explicitly assigned, the test will run in the last shard.
#
#   Jenkins-specific configuration details:
#
#   - The edx-platform git repository is checked out by the Jenkins git plugin.
#   - Jenkins logs in as user "jenkins"
#   - The Jenkins file system root is "/home/jenkins"
#   - An init script creates a virtualenv at "/home/jenkins/edx-venv"
#     with some requirements pre-installed (such as scipy)
#
#  Jenkins worker setup:
#  See the edx/configuration repo for Jenkins worker provisioning scripts.
#  The provisioning scripts install requirements that this script depends on!
