"""
This module defines SafeSessionMiddleware that makes use of a
SafeCookieData that cryptographically binds the user to the session id
in the cookie.

The implementation is inspired by the proposal in the following paper:
http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf

Note: The proposed protocol protects against replay attacks by
incorporating the session key used in the SSL connection.  However,
this does not suit our needs since we want the ability to reuse the
same cookie over multiple SSL connections.  So instead, we mitigate
replay attacks by enforcing session cookie expiration
(via TimestampSigner) and assuming SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE (see below).

We use django's built-in Signer class, which makes use of a built-in
salted_hmac function that derives a usage-specific key from the
server's SECRET_KEY, as proposed in the paper.

Note: The paper proposes deriving a usage-specific key from the
session's expiration time in order to protect against volume attacks.
However, since django does not always use an expiration time, we
instead use a random key salt to prevent volume attacks.

In fact, we actually use a specialized subclass of Signer called
TimestampSigner. This signer binds a timestamp along with the signed
data and verifies that the signature has not expired.  We do this
since django's session stores do not actually verify the expiration
of the session cookies.  Django instead relies on the browser to honor
session cookie expiration.

The resulting safe cookie data that gets stored as the value in the
session cookie is a tuple of:
    (
        version,
        session_id,
        key_salt,
        signature
    )

    where signature is:
        signed_data : base64(HMAC_SHA1(signed_data, usage_key))

    where signed_data is:
        H(version | session_id | user_id) : timestamp

    where usage_key is:
        SHA1(key_salt + 'signer' + settings.SECRET_KEY)

Note: We assume that the SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE setting is set to
TRUE to prevent inadvertent leakage of the session cookie to a
person-in-the-middle.  The SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE flag indicates
to the browser that the cookie should be sent only over an
SSL-protected channel.  Otherwise, a session hijacker could copy
the entire cookie and use it to impersonate the victim.
